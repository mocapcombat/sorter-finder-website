        Every night we go to sleep <br>and when we wake up <br>we eat the same breakfast;
      </p>

      <p>
        A bowl of oatmeal,<br> usually with yoghurt, nuts, <br>maybe some coconut rasp.
        I like to add chia seeds and almonds.
        Or sweet things like banana or chocolate.
        Mostly always, <br>I put in some blueberries.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is one of many things I repeat.<br>
        As many of us who live a repetitive life.<br>
        Some other things people like to repeat are:
      </p>

      <p>laughter, talking, walking</p>

      <p>
        I repeat the thoughts I have had in my head before and share them with the same people
        <br>who I have shared them with before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moments become clear nature to us<br>
        and they change again and become<br>
        mixed up in new natures.
      </p>

      <p>
        We reveal ourselves to each other again and the way we come to know us is by repetition.
        Though, as Gertrude Stein says;
      </p>

      <p>there is no such thing.</p>

      This is a website containing every blueberry in a 500 gram package from a normal supermarket in The Netherlands. 
      I attempted naming them after everyone I know and who knows, or knew me.
